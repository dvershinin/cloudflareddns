A tiny command line utility for implementing DDNS with Cloudflare.

* Supports virtually any server that is capable of running Python
* Synology DiskStations supported
* Quick to install using `yum/dnf` or `pip`

## Synopsis

Update DNS A record for `foo.example.com` to `1.2.3.4`

```bash
cloudflareddns --hostname foo.example.com --ip 1.2.3.4
```

Likewise, for an AAAA record:

```bash
cloudflareddns --hostname foo.example.com --ip 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
```

Get all options by simply running `cloudflareddns -h`:

```
usage: cloudflareddns [-h] [--email EMAIL] [--key KEY] [--hostname HOSTNAME]
                      [--ip IP] [--ttl TTL] [--verbose] [--version]

Update DDNS in Cloudflare.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --email EMAIL        Cloudflare account email (omit if using API tokens)
  --key KEY            Cloudflare API key or token
  --hostname HOSTNAME  Hostname to set IP for
  --ip IP              The IP address
  --ttl TTL            TTL in seconds
  --verbose
  --version            show program's version number and exit
```

When invoked without any options, `cloudflareddns` will try to point the
FQDN (aka `<hostname>.<domain-name>` of the machine it runs on to its public IP address (auto-detected).

## Install and use with Synology DiskStations

You can configure a Synology DiskStation with CloudFlare DDNS.

**It's worth noting that if your Synology DSM is recent enough, you can simply use Synology's own DDNS service, then create a `CNAME` record at your domain that points to it. The downside to this solution, however, is extra DNS lookup required to resolve domain to IP.**

Alternative solution is to use `cloudflaredns` which ships with the necessary CLI interface for Synology compatibility: `cloudflareddns-syno`.
    
### Step 1. Access Synology via SSH

* Login to your DSM
* Go to Control Panel > Terminal & SNMP > Enable SSH service
* Use your client or commandline to access Synology. If you don't have any, I recommend you try out Putty for Windows.
* Use your Synology admin account to connect.

### Step 2. Install `cloudflareddns`

If you're not a lazy man, checkout [instructions on installing using virtualenv](SAFE-INSTALL.md) for this step.
For quick setup instead:

    curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python
    pip install cloudflareddns

Run the following command to add new DDNS provider:

```
cat >> /etc/ddns_provider.conf << 'EOF'
[USER_Cloudflare]
        modulepath=/bin/cloudflareddns-syno
        queryurl=https://www.cloudflare.com/
EOF
```

### Step 3. Get Cloudflare parameters

It is recommended to use a Cloudflare API *token*.
Check the [wiki page](https://github.com/dvershinin/cloudflareddns/wiki/Token-Authentication) 
for instructions on how to get an API token with the most secure permissions.

Alternatively, you can get Cloudflare global API key in your account settings.

### Step 4. Setup DDNS

* Login to your DSM
* Go to Control Panel > External Access > DDNS > Add
* Select Cloudflare as service provider
* Enter your domain as hostname
* If using token authentication: enter `x` in the Username/Email, and API token as Password/Key.
The requirement to put `x` is due to Synology GUI's constraints not allowing for an empty field   
* If using global API key: enter your Cloudflare account as Username/Email, and API key as Password/Key

## Installation for CentOS/RHEL 7, 8

    sudo yum -y install https://extras.getpagespeed.com/release-latest.rpm
    sudo yum install cloudflareddns
    
## Installation for other systems

Installing with `pip` is easiest:

    pip install cloudflareddns

## Usage in Python scripts

```python
from cloudflareddns import cloudflareddns
hostname = 'foo.example.com'
ip = '1.2.3.4'
if cloudflareddns.updateRecord(hostname, ip):
  print('Record is OK')
  ...
```

Requires using environment variables (see tips below).

## Specifying Cloudflare credentials

In non-Synology systems, you can store Cloudflare credentials in either environment 
variables or a configuration file.

### Via configuration file

Create `~/.cloudflare/cloudflare.cfg` and put:

```ini
[CloudFlare]
email = user@example.com # Do not set if using an API Token
token = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Via environment variables

You can put your Cloudflare credentials into the `~/.bashrc` file:

```bash
export CF_API_EMAIL="user@example.com" # Do not set if using an API Token
export CF_API_KEY="xxxxxx"
```

Don't forget to `source ~/.bashrc` if you have just put credentials in there.
The `cloudflareddns` will pick those up, so no need to pass `--email` or `--key` every time.
